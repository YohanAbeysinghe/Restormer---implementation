# Restormer

A PyTorch implementation of Restormer based on CVPR 2022 paper
[Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09881), which I did a presentation on for the Advances for Machine Vision Module.

The training was done using Tesla A100 in Google Colab.
